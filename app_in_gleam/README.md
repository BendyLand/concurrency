# Concurrency App in Gleam

This program will perform a similar computation to the concurrency program written in Go. 

## Purpose

This project will serve as an introduction to Gleam, since I recently learned about it and found it interesting. 

Since Gleam is built on top of Erlang, I thought it was only appropriate for my first project with it to include concurrency. 

That said, since I am still relatively new to using concurrency, I will be using my Go project as a reference.
