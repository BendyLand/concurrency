# Go Concurrency Practice

The purpose of this project is to help me learn the basics of concurrency in general as well as in Go. 

## Usage

1) Run the program with `go run main.go`.
2) You will be asked how many random numbers you want to generate. 
    - Invalid inputs will loop the program until you manually exit or a until a valid input is received. 
3) That's it! The program will automatically divide the list of numbers to concurrently sum them. The program will print out your results.
