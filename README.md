# Concurrency

## Purpose

This repository will hold projects whose primary concern is concurrency. 

I am currently a beginner with concurrency. My goal by the time I am finished with these projects is to have a deeper understanding of the mechanics by which concurrency works, as well as what situations it can and should be effectively used for.
